Mobizen for mirroring android device, controlling device, and screen capture

openCV for image processing and hopefully console later on
http://opencv.org/

PyAutoGUI for cursor movement
http://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

wxpython for cursor detection and backup for the console:

Putting time into the console will pay off majorly in the long run.
